# Movie Trailer Website Project
Movie Trailer Website is a site that lists my favorite movies.
## Learning Class, Instance, and everything nice...
Each movie is an instance of Movie class I created in the file midia.py

class Movie():

    def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube):
        self.title = movie_title
        self.storyline = movie_storyline
